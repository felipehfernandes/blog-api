# Blog API!

<details>
  <summary><strong>üë®‚Äçüíª What was developed</strong></summary>

  In this project an API and a database were developed for the production of content for a blog!

  The application was developed in `Node.js` using the `sequelize` package to make a `CRUD` of posts.

   1. Endpoints were developed that are connected to the database following REST principles;

   2. To make a post you need a user and a login, so the **relationship between** `user` and `post` is worked on;

   3. Categories were used for the posts, thus working the **relation of** `posts` to `categories` and `categories` to `posts`.

  #### Entities format

  The project uses `ORM Sequelize` to create and update the database.

   - A table called **users**, contains data with the following structure:

    | id  | display_name    | email           | password | image                                                                                   |
